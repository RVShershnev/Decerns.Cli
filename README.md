# About MCDA/MCDM
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a decision-making methodology used to evaluate and prioritize options or alternatives based on multiple criteria or objectives. This approach is widely used in various fields, including business, engineering, environmental management, and public policy.

In MCDA, decision-makers identify a set of criteria that are relevant to the decision problem and assign weights to each criterion to reflect its relative importance. Then, they evaluate each alternative against each criterion, typically using a numerical scale or a rating system. The scores are often normalized to ensure that all criteria are treated equally.

Once the evaluations are complete, MCDA provides a systematic way to aggregate the scores and determine the overall ranking of the alternatives. There are several methods to aggregate the scores, such as simple additive weighting, weighted sum, and multi-attribute utility theory.

MCDA can help decision-makers to structure complex problems, consider multiple perspectives, and make informed and transparent decisions. However, it requires careful consideration of the criteria and weights, as well as the assumptions and uncertainties underlying the evaluations. Additionally, MCDA does not provide a definitive answer, but rather a set of options that meet different objectives to varying degrees.
